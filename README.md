Welcome to my GitHub profile!

```java
public class SoftwareEngineer {

    private String name;
    private String role;
    private String[] languages;
    private String[] techStack;
    private String[] hobbies;

    public SoftwareEngineer() {
        name = "Angie Yang";
        role = "Aspiring Full Stack Engineer";
        languages = {"Java", "JavaScript", "Python", "SQL", "Mandarin", "Cantonese"};
        techStack = {"MongoDB", "Express.js", "React", "Node.js", "Spring Boot", "Angular"};
        hobbies = {"hot yoga/Pilates", "Lego", reading", "learning new things"};
    }

    public void sayHi() {
        System.out.println("Hello, I'm " + this.name + ", a " + this.role + ".");
        System.out.println("I can speak " + String.join(", ", Arrays.copyOfRange(this.languages, 4, 6)) + ", and code in " + String.join(", ", Arrays.copyOfRange(this.languages, 0, 4)) + ". That's right, I'm bilingual in both human and computer languages!");
        System.out.println("I have experience working with " + String.join(", ", this.techStack).");
        System.out.println("I'm always eager to learn new technologies and frameworks to enhance my skills and deliver quality products.");
        System.out.println("In my spare time, I like " + String.join(", ", this.hobbies) + ".");
        System.out.println("Thanks for dropping by! I'm excited to connect with fellow developers!");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SoftwareEngineer me = new SoftwareEngineer();
        me.sayHi();
    }
}

```

I'm proficient in various programming languages, including Java (just the coffee â˜•), JavaScript, Python and SQL, and I'm actively working with full stack technologies such as MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) to build interactive web applications.
