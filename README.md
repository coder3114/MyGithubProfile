# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

```java
class SoftwareEngineer {

    public SoftwareEngineer() {
        this.name = "Angie Yang";
        this.role = "Aspiring Full Stack Engineer";
        this.languages = new String[]{"Java", "JavaScript", "Python"};
        this.techStack = "MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)";
    }

    public void sayHi() {
        System.out.println("Thanks for dropping by! I'm excited to connect with fellow developers!");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SoftwareEngineer me = new SoftwareEngineer();
        me.sayHi();
    }
}
```

I'm proficient in various programming languages, including Java (just the coffee â˜•), JavaScript, and Python, and I'm actively working with full stack technologies such as MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) to build interactive web applications.
